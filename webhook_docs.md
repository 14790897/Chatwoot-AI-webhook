How to use webhooks?
Last updated on May 09, 2025
Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that are set up for each account. These are triggered when actions such as creating a message occur in Chatwoot. Multiple webhooks can be created for a single account.

How to add a webhook?
Step 1. Go to Settings → Integrations → Webhooks. Click on the "Configure" button.



Step 2. Click on the "Add new webhook" button. A modal will open up. Here, input the URL to which the POST request should be sent. Next, you need to select the events you want to subscribe. This option would allow you to only listen to the relevant events in Chatwoot.



Chatwoot will send a POST request with the following payload to the configured URLs for various updates in your account.
